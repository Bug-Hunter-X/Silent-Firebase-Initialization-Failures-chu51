This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive Firebase bug: silent initialization failures.  The `firebaseBug.js` file shows code that attempts to initialize Firebase without proper error handling. This often leads to runtime errors later in the app. `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a solution with improved error handling and checking for initialization success before proceeding with Firebase operations.
